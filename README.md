#Face Mask Detection Model

Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based model for detecting whether a person is wearing a face mask or not in an image. The model is trained on a dataset of images labeled with and without face masks.

Features


Detection of face mask presence in images.

High accuracy in classifying images with or without face masks.

Installation

To use this model, you'll need Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:

Pytorch
NumPy

You can install these dependencies using pip:

pip install pytorch-python numpy

Usage

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Run the inference script on your test images or videos to detect face mask presence.



python detect_mask.py --image test_image.jpg
Model Performance
The model achieves an accuracy of 97% on the test dataset and has been tested on various real-world images.

Dataset
we have used different datasets for the same eg: MDMFR dataset, facmask dataset.
